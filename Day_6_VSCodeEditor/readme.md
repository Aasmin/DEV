# Road Map for VS CODE Editor:
Deadline: 11 Oct 2020 - 4 days
## Observed: Mostly the library integrations will be done. (Learning)
Use Monaco Editor in the editor area.(can also try codeMirror/Ace editor)
Reference: https://github.com/microsoft/monaco-editor-samples/blob/master/electron-amd-nodeIntegration/electron-index.html
Use Jstree for the file structure area. [i.e to show file heirarchy] (Didn't use w2ui as it slows down the opening)
How to integrate Terminal? 
* Xterm (for UI) - I/P lega
For installing Xterm, Make sure to have: 
   * node-gpy
   * python 2.7
   * node 10+
* node-pty? (for shell commands) -shell ko chlae ga,
