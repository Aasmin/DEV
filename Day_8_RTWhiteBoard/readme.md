#### Rough Idea
* JS: DOM manipulation (Document API) [Practising it: as browser ka code mostly cpp mein likha hota hai. So directly interact nhi kr skte browser ki renedering process se. Therefoe DOM API is used where document is at top of DOM.]
* For Server: Express, Socket.io (for real time communication)
* Draw: Canvas API (as google maps also uses canvas). Reference: https://developer.mozilla.org/en-US/docs/Learn/JavaScript/Client-side_web_APIs/Drawing_graphics
* File Upload: Browswer API
* Electron -> Deploy webapp / Deploying server?
* EXE Creation?
* Learn Webrtc? EXTRAS
